### 1. Problem Statement
In a route-finding application, there are several modes of transport (driving, walking, air, train) for which different algorithms are needed to calculate the optimal routes. Hardcoding the route-finding logic for each transport mode within the main application would lead to a rigid design, making the code difficult to maintain and extend as new strategies (e.g., bicycle, bus) need to be added. Additionally, managing this logic would require changes across multiple parts of the application, which could introduce errors and complicate future updates.

### 2. Solution
The Factory Method Pattern is used to decouple the creation of different route-finding strategies from the main application. The `RouteFinder` class, which handles route-finding logic, delegates the responsibility of selecting the appropriate strategy (driving, walking, air, train) to a dedicated `RouteStrategyFactory` class. The factory method inside this class decides which concrete route-finding strategy (implementing the `IRouteStrategy` interface) to instantiate based on the user’s selected mode of transport.

Each strategy (like `AirRouteStrategy`, `DrivingRouteStrategy`, `TrainRouteStrategy`, etc.) is encapsulated as a separate class that implements the `IRouteStrategy` interface. The `RouteFinder` class uses this strategy to call the appropriate `FindRoute` method.

### 3. Why This Is the Solution and Better Design
Using the Factory Method Pattern offers several benefits that enhance the design and scalability of the system:
- **Separation of Concerns**: The `RouteFinder` focuses only on finding routes, while the `RouteStrategyFactory` is responsible for creating the appropriate strategy. This makes the code more organized and modular.
- **Flexibility and Extensibility**: New route strategies can be added without changing existing code. If a new mode of transport (e.g., bicycle) needs to be supported, a new strategy class implementing `IRouteStrategy` can be added and the factory method will handle its instantiation. This reduces the risk of breaking existing functionality.
- **Decoupling**: By using the factory to create strategy objects, the client code (like `RouteFinder`) does not need to know the details of how the strategies are implemented, promoting loose coupling. This makes future changes easier and less prone to errors.
- **Maintainability**: The system becomes easier to maintain because each strategy is isolated in its own class. Developers can modify, test, and extend individual strategies without affecting the rest of the system.

This approach follows key principles of object-oriented design such as **open/closed principle**, where the system is open for extension (new strategies) but closed for modification (existing code doesn't need changes).
