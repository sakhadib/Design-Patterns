## Custom T-Shirt Design Application

#### 🧵 Company: **ThreadMagic – Custom T-Shirt Printing**

**Business Context:**
ThreadMagic is a custom t-shirt printing company that allows customers to design their own shirts online. Each design has properties like:
- Shape of the print (e.g., Circle or Square)
- Color of the design
- Name or Label for the design

Customers often want to:
- Create a base design
- Clone it quickly
- Apply slight modifications (like a color change) without affecting the original

---

### ✅ **Problem:**
Designing from scratch every time for minor changes is inefficient and time-consuming, especially when handling bulk orders with slight variations.

---

### 💡 **Proposed Solution Using the Code:**
Use the **Prototype Pattern** to:
- Create base shape designs (like `Circle` or `Square`)
- Clone them easily using `.Clone()` method
- Allow customers to change color or name of the cloned version while keeping the original intact

---

### 👨‍💻 How the Current Code Helps:

```csharp
Ishape circle = new Circle("Red", "LogoBase");
Ishape clonedCircle = circle.Clone();
clonedCircle.SetColor("Black"); // For a black version of the same logo
```

This allows the business to:
- Quickly generate multiple versions of a design
- Reduce memory and processing cost
- Avoid errors from repeated manual configuration

---

### 📈 Business Benefits:
- Faster design turnaround
- Better customer experience with live previews of multiple variants
- Lower development and maintenance overhead
